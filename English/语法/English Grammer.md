## 从句

### 1. that从句前面宾语不能是介词

错误示例：

*I am sure <u>of that</u>  the team has won the game.*



**解决方法**

（1）介词 + the fact + that 从句

​	例句：

​		*I am sure <u>of that</u> the team has won the game.*  <font color="red">(X)</font>  --> *I am sure <u>of the fact that</u> the team has won the game.*

​		*I am worried <u>about the fact that</u> he doesn't study.* 



（2）保留介词

+ 第一步：去掉that
+ 第二步：that后面的主语变成宾格
+ 第三步：动词变成动名词

​	例句：

​		*I am worried about <u>that he plays</u> around all day.*  <font color="red">(X)</font>  --> *I am worried about <u>his playing</u>* around all day.

​	

> 注：
>
> + 如果that从句有do、does、did时，将其去掉即可
>
>   *I am worried about that he doesn't study.* <font color="red">(X)</font>  --> *I am worried about his not studying.*
>
> + that从句若有will或者would时，将其去掉即可
>
>   *I am sure of that the team will win the game.* <font color="red">(X)</font> --> *I am sure of the team's winning the game.*
>
> + 从句若有以下助动词，做如下变化
>
>   + may   -->  be likely to
>   + can    -->  be able to
>
>   *I am happy about that he may come.* <font color="red">(X)</font> --> *I am happy about his being like to come.*
>
>   *I am sure of that he can do it. *  <font color="red">(X)</font> --> *I am sure of his being able to do it.*



（3）be + adj + that从句，去掉介词，将that从句放在形容词后面

​	例句：

​		*I am worried about that he plays around all day.*  <font color="red">(X)</font>  -->  *I am worried that he plays around all day.*

​		*I am sure of that the team has won the game.* --> *I am sure that the team has won the game.*



> 注：
>
> 有时候介词之后可以直接接上that从句，不需要the fact
>
> + in that = because
>
>   ​	*He is talented <u>in that</u> he can speak five different languages.*
>
> + except that  只可惜；除了
>
>   ​	*He is nice <u>except that</u> sometimes he lies.*
>
> + notwithstanding that = despite the fact that = in spite of the fact that   尽管
>
>   ​	*<u>Notwithstanding that</u> he is nice, I don't like him.*
>
>   ​	*<u>Despite the fact that</u> he is nice, I don't like him.*
>
>   ​	*<u>In spite of the fact that</u> he is nice, I don't like him.*



## 动词

### 1. 动词分类

+ 及物动词：后面必须加上宾语，例如like： I like her.
+ 不及物动词：后面不需要加上宾语，例如laugh： He laughed.

### 2. 认定动词

意思为：“视......为”

（1）与介词连用

​	We <u>regard</u> / <u>look upon</u> / <u>think of</u> / <u>see</u> / <u>view</u> him as a genius.    我们都把他视为天才 



（2）与 to be 连用

​	We <u>consider</u> / <u>deem</u> / <u>think</u> him to be a genius. ==  We <u>consider</u> / <u>deem</u> / <u>think</u> him a genius.
